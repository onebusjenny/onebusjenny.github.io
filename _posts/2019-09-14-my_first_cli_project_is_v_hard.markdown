I would say it's kind of challenging to do this project, since the very first website that I decided to scrape from got entirely redesigned, so I had to start over. In the end I decided to use my own portfolio website that I know for sure will not disappear or get change, at least not in the near future.

I deleted some old code and added some new code. I started with Scraper class, by changing the URL to my own website and tried to find the right CSS to grab from the index page where all the projects are at. It was a struggle because I grab the wrong CSS the first few times and the information wouldn't come out, that all I get was an empty array. "TBH, it was sooo annoying. " At the same time, I went into my Portfolio class to make sure that the information i scraped will be create d into a new object and is able to be printed out in a list.

Finally in the end, I finally got the right one and was able to print the entire list out from 1 to 11 with the project name, since there are 11 projects on my website. 

It was a very hyped moment and happy, VERY JOYFUL, because I finally get it to work.

However, it was just half of the project, I still need to finish the other half, which is the scraping the :title, :category, :description from each individual project's URL and display it when I select that one project. It should only be printing out the :title, :category, :description that belongs to that project. 

I remember having a hard to just to figure out how to, but luckily I have a good cohort friend who is willing to help me through this part. During this part of code, I also went back to Student Scraper just to check how I did the code there since it's similar to what my project is doing, grabbing information from index and also grab the information from the individual student, in my case, is my project. I went back and ford just to see how and what might work, testing out, running the terminal, "binding.pry" all the way. AND finally, it worked! When I make sure my CSS selector is grabbing the right thing and that it's working with my cli class perfectly. 

Even though I got it to print out the list and be able to respond to the user when the user type 1-11, I am still stuck at this probelm where it does print out all the :title, :category and :description, but it's not just 1's title, category and description, it's ALL the title, category and descripton from all the projects. It got printed out all at once instead of getting assigned to individual project. Hopefully someone can help me with that lol

I would say overall it's a very challenging journey but somehow I sort of made it to work. I do feel smart using Visual studio and taggling all the problems and errors down. Throughout the project, binding.pry became my best friend haha.
