So, why coding? 

I've been asking myself that whenever I'm stuck on some lessons/ errors. I'm a student at the School of 
the Art Institute of Chicago with an emphasis in Visual Communication Design. People ask me, "why are you learning coding?? you don't need it to be a graphic designer", I ask myself too, why am I doing this to myself? then, I found my answer. 

I always thought coding is like a nono zone for me since I lowkey think I'm just not a computer science kinda girl. But what changed my mind is when I see so many different platforms that have been created and published on to App store, that kind of feeling stroked me. Also, with the feeling that "if I know coding, I could definetly combine it with UI/UX or website design, since these two are somewhat related to each other in multiple ways." Also, because my older brother seems smarter than me that he is studying computer science for grad. So, I thought, "why not?". I should learn as many as possible when I still can and collect as many skills into my skillset as possible when I am still young.
